# ⚠️ THIS BRANCH IS DEPRECATED AND WILL NOT BE MAINTAINED FURTHER ⚠️

# dots
The dotfiles I use on my Arch+ZSH+Herbstluftwm system. Hopefully you can find
something helpful in here. :smile:

Some of the programs I use:
* Herbstluftwm
* Neovim (Configured partly in `lua` and partly in `vimscript`. See [this
  branch](https://github.com/CodePurble/dots/tree/nvim-lua) for a pure `lua`
  configuration)
* Alacritty
* Polybar

A lot scripts were inspired by or taken from those available in
[voidrice](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice). You should check it out!

These dotfiles are managed using [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).
